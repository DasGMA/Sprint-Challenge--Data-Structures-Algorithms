Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
    The complexity of `depth_first_for_each` method is O(n).

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
    Space complexity is also O(n).

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    The complexity of `breadth_first_for_each` method is O(n).

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    Space complexity is O(n).

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
    The runtime complexity of 'heapsort' function is O(n log (n)).
    
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
    The time complexity without altering the input array would be O(n). However, if we have altered the input array, then time complexity would be O(1).
